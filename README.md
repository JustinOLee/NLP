Please look at "models.py" for a1 and a2, "inference.py" for a3, and "transformer.py", "transformer_lm.py" for a4.

A1: Trained a perceptron model and a logistic regression model on unigrams and bigrams. 
The dataset is the movie review dataset of Socher et al. (2013) and the models predict
the sentiment of a snippet with ~80% accuracy.

A2: Trained a feedforward neural networks in PyTorch.

A3: Implemented the Viterbi algorithm as well as beam search for a HMM to predict part of speech tags.

A4: Implemented a transformer language model to predict upcoming characters.

Final: Research Paper
